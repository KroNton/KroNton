# Welcome to my Github profile! 👋

🤖 I am a Robotics Software Engineer with a focus on developing Autonomous Mobile Robots using the Robot Operating System (ROS). My passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge technologies and innovative algorithms to create intelligent robots that can operate in dynamic environments.

🚀 On this page, you will find my contributions to various open-source projects related to robotics, including ROS packages for localization, mapping, path planning, and control of mobile robots. I also actively participate in the ROS community by providing support, contributing to discussions, and sharing my knowledge with others.

💻 My expertise in programming languages such as C++, and Python, combined with my experience with ROS, enables me to build reliable and efficient robotic systems. I am always seeking to learn and improve my skills, and I am open to collaboration and feedback from the community.


## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can find on my Github:

- [Autonomous Home Service Robot](https://github.com/KroNton/Home-Service-Robot) 🤖🏠 An autonomous home service robot that can perform tasks such as cleaning, delivery, and security. This project includes a mobile base, an arm with various end-effectors, a vision system for object detection and tracking, and a natural language processing system for human-robot interaction. The robot is programmed using ROS and can be controlled remotely or run autonomously.

- [6DOF Robot Arm](https://github.com/KroNton/six_degree_robot_arm) 🤖🦾 A 6DOF robot arm that can be programmed to perform complex manipulations and assembly tasks. This project includes a custom-designed arm with high-precision motors and sensors, a ROS-based control system with forward and inverse kinematics algorithms, and various end-effectors such as grippers, suction cups, and cameras. The robot arm can be controlled using a joystick or programmed using ROS and MoveIt!.

- [Lowlevel Controller for Mobile Robot](https://github.com/KroNton/differential_drive_arduino) ⚙️🤖 A low-level controller for mobile robots using Arduino and ROSControl. This project includes a custom-designed hardware board based on the Arduino platform, as well as a software stack for controlling the robot's motors, sensors, and actuators using ROS messages and services. The controller is modular and can be easily adapted to different robot platforms and applications.
